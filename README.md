# Welcome!
Thank you for signing up as an event coordinator!

Your support is so important, thank you for volunteering to help. We rely on you to help ensure the event runs smoothly. Below are some typical processes to help you with the event set up and check in process.

Please familiarize yourself with the [CoderDojoTC website](http://www.coderdojotc.org) so you can answer questions from parents.  [CoderDojo](http://www.coderdojo.com) is an international movement of coding clubs for kids; each one is different. CoderDojo Twin Cities was launched on April 13, 2013 and is one of the largest CoderDojos in the world. CoderDojoTC has also helped inspire 5 other CoderDojos in Minnesota: Katie CoderDojo, Tonka CoderDojo, SW CoderDojo, Northfield CoderDojo and So MN CoderDojo. 

# Arrival

Event volunteers arrive at the University of Minnesota at 12:30 p.m. to help set up for check in which begins on event day at 1 p.m. Mentors and children of mentors can enter the room for set up, but students should be asked to wait until 1:20 p.m. to enter the room. They can wait outside and you can let them know when it’s time.
Table set up

We need a table to serve as a check in point. Typically we use one of the taller oval tables just in front of the One Stop when we are on the third floor. On other floors we have had to be resourceful so feel free to get creative, to ask for help moving tables (they are heavy) and to set up an “official looking” check in area. We are not able to use the one stop desk.

# Coordinator resources bin

There will be a plastic bin with nametags, administrative items (pens, paper, etc.) on one of the tables. Please feel free to access what you need in this bin.

# iPad

iPad - get the iPad for check in from Matt. It should already be connected to Eventbrite, but he can help you with this if needed. Log into U of M wifi using the user name and password on your nametag. Please do not leave the iPad unattended. Return to Matt at the end of the event.

# Group assignment list

There will be a couple copies of the group assignment spreadsheet for your use to guide students to groups at check in. You will find this with the iPad or Matt will have it for you.

# Signage

Inside each classroom there are rolling dry erase boards. One sign should be placed where all who approach the classrooms will see saying: “Welcome to Coder Dojo Twin Cities! Mentors and students please check in at the table” with an arrow to check in table. If there are two rooms feel free to use a second and third sign to indicate which groups are in which rooms to help students find their rooms.

# Nametags

Matt will have the name tags, or there will be paper name tags in the volunteer bin with plastic name tag holders. You can do this at the check in table as you wait for mentors to arrive.
Nametags are given to you sorted by group. They have the wifi user name and password for each student.Place the nametag in the holder and place the nametags with their groups.

# Check in process

Be sure to check in each mentor as they arrive - the ones that are there for set up need to check in too so you may have to ask for their names when you are in the room.

<ul>
<li>Welcome each person and thank them for coming</li>
<li>Ask for their name</li>
<li>Check in on the Eventbrite App on the iPad</li>
<li>Look up code group and let them know which room they will be in</li>
<li>Let them know they can enter to pick up their name tag at 1:20</li>
</ul>

# After check in

Most students and mentors arrive by 1:45 p.m. but one volunteer should stay at the desk until 2:15 just in case. At that point, you can place a sign on the desk (or use a rolling dry erase board) to direct those with questions to come inside the main classroom for help. Please do not leave the iPad unattended.

You can be very helpful at this point in the event by walking around, asking students what they are learning, making small talk with parents and paying close attention to what is going on in the Scratch group if you are interested in becoming a mentor in that group someday.
End of event

It is important at the end of the event to clean up and help get everything put back.

<ul>
<li>Collect nametags</li>
<li>Recycle paper nametags</li>
<li>Bundle plastic nametag holders neatly and store in administrative box</li>
<li>Return administrative items to administrative box</li>
<li>Return iPad to Matt</li>
<li>Return signs, markers and erasers to classrooms</li>
